## Description: 
  <hr>  
FRMW, or Facial Recognition: Most Wanted, emulates a Business Reporting system, in which an entity such as a business can reliably and quick report and track a variety of incidents. There are several reasons such entities would track any number of incidents, one of the most prominent is Security. They would like to keep reports on unwelcome parties, and ensure there is a central hub available to employees to read such reports and become familiar with these individuals   
  <hr>  
This project seeks to extend the capabilities of such a system. It is reasonable that these reports would capture an image of the inidividuals they wish to track, and ideally it would be an image of their face. This system uses a facial recognition system that is fed a video stream from some camera in the establishment, that will process the video and look for any faces that match against images saved from the reporting system. On such a match, this system will send out a notificiation to all parties currently accessing this reporting system to alert them of the undesired individual.

Product such as this are not 'new', nor are they 'revolutionairy' in the current market. However, this project allows us as developers to emulate real world solutions that presently exist. Doing so will provide us with some expectation of a real-world setting and environment. This also allows us to utilize AI technology that is popular in today's industry giving us invaluable experience and exposure.
